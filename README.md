Here’s a **clean, concise `README.md`** you can directly copy into your GitHub repo.
It explains the project, architecture, and run commands without being verbose.

# 🐱 Cross-Site Real-Time Dashboard (Socket.IO)

A connected multi-project system where one dashboard **controls** another in real time, while both display **independently updating cat facts** every 3 seconds.

Built using **React + Express + Socket.IO**, with the server acting as the **single source of truth**.

## 🧠 How It Works

- The **server**:
  - Fetches cat facts from a public API
  - Maintains global dashboard state (lock, hide, data)
  - Broadcasts updates via Socket.IO

- **Project 1 (Control Panel)**:
  - Locks/unlocks sections
  - Hides/shows sections
  - Receives real-time updates

- **Project 2 (Display View)**:
  - Read-only mirror of server state
  - Updates instantly via WebSockets

✔ No polling  
✔ Optimized API usage  
✔ Each section has its **own cat fact**  

---

## ⚙️ Prerequisites

- Node.js (v14+)
- npm

---

## ▶️ How to Run the Project

### 1️⃣ Start the Backend
```bash
cd dashboard-backend
npm install
node server.js
````

Server runs on: **[http://localhost:3001](http://localhost:3001)**

---

### 2️⃣ Start Project 1 (Control Panel)

```bash
cd project-1
npm install
npm run dev
```

---

### 3️⃣ Start Project 2 (Display View)

```bash
cd project-2
npm install
npm run dev
```

## 🔗 Tech Stack

* React (Vite)
* Express.js
* Socket.IO
* node-fetch
* Public Cat Facts API

---

## 📌 Notes

* The server is the **single source of truth**
* UI structure is preserved to support existing CSS
* State updates are pushed in real time using WebSockets

---

## 🚀 Future Improvements

* Redis-backed Socket.IO scaling
* Docker Compose setup
* Authentication & role-based control
* Analytics / monitoring dashboard

```

If you want, I can also:
- Add **badges** (Node, React, Socket.IO)
- Create a **Docker-based README**
- Write a **portfolio-friendly project description**
- Add **architecture diagrams section**

Just tell me 👍
